Project Description: Pomodoro Timer Application
Project Overview:
The Pomodoro Timer application is a productivity tool that helps users manage their work and break intervals effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The application consists of a timer that alternates between work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks based on predefined time intervals.

Built Features:

Timer Reset Functionality: Implemented a reset feature to cancel the timer and reset the current session.
Timer Mechanism: Created a mechanism to handle the timer logic including work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
Countdown Mechanism: Developed a countdown mechanism to display the time remaining in minutes and seconds format.
UI Setup: Designed the user interface using tkinter library with components like labels, buttons, and canvas for visual representation.


Key Learning Points:

Python Programming: Enhanced Python skills by implementing timer logic, UI components, and event handling.
Pomodoro Technique: Gained understanding of the Pomodoro Technique for time management and productivity improvement.
Canvas Manipulation: Learned how to create and configure canvas elements for graphical display in tkinter.
Event Handling: Implemented event-driven programming to handle user interactions such as starting and stopping the timer.

Technical Terms:

tkinter: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for creating desktop applications.
Canvas: A tkinter widget used for drawing shapes, images, and text in a window.
Global Variables: Variables that are accessible and modifiable throughout the program.
Countdown Function: A function that updates the timer display and manages the countdown logic.
Event-driven Programming: A programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions or system notifications.
This project not only enhanced my Python skills but also provided practical experience in building a functional application that can boost productivity and time management efficiency.
